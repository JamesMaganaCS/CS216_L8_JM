* class definition style & standards:  first, member vars  none per line and do not forget to initialize them;  second functions: separate group of functions  by a blank line; either matching setter/getter pairs or list all setters back to back and list all getters back to back; start with a default c’tor, followed by  copy c’tor (if any), then other c’tors in the order of increased number of arguments, d’tor- right after c’tor(s), overloaded functions- list them back to back in the order of increased number of arguments;  all accessor/getter functions should be const; all functions with more than one statement should be normal (defined externally, outside of the class and below main()), no inline functions with more than one statement; initialize all member variables to appropriate default values at the time of definition; all member variables must be private; classes must provide a strong exception guarantee; must have default c’tor; implement Rule of Three when necessary
* missing default c’tor(s) -2
* 234 cannot handle “whole” -5
* Fraction& Fraction::operator=(const Fraction& other) should use setFraction for consistency -2
* 20-21 what’s is the purpose of  default numerator/denominator const if you are not using them?-2
* 80-81 should create a highly reusable function that takes an error message string as a parameter and clears the failed input; it does not need to ask the user to re-enter, the menu loop already does it  -2
*   allows fraction where whole >0  && numerator>denominator; 3 8/3? -5
*  239 and like: if a user enters a value of a wrong data type, the program goes into an infinite loop; should create a highly reusable function that takes an error message string as a parameter, clears the failed input and outputs the error message to be called in the default case of the menu switch -5
* 122, 164 and like poor and redundant technique; all setter functions, including all c’tors’, should be calling setter function that sets all member variables (e.g., setAll()); it helps to avoid redundancy, promotes consistency, and ease of future modifications, call setAll() inside all other individual setter functions, including c’tor(s); this way validation and set statements are not all over the class code; you can make validator functions static so they can be called without an object; see assignment -5
 * 122 and like, poor  and redundant logic;  setFraction with 3args should be the only functions used for validation; exceptions should be caught and dealt with in setFraction()  with 3 args; this way validation and set statements are not all over the class code; no need to rethrow exceptions; if validateFraction() is called by a c’tor and throws an exception, a Fraction object will not be created, you might have an id for an object for not the object itself;  initialize member vars at the definition time and do not update them unless new/incoming values are valid; see assignment; discussed in class -5
* no need for  void print() const;
* modularization: each menu option should have its own function with a possible exception of the QUIT case; as a rule of thumb, if a case in a switch has more than 2 statements, make it a function; -5
* multiple return statements in a non-recursive function; may result in unreachable return; use if/else, use a variable to store the results and return the variable; e.g. a function to check the length of a string, function to validate account number,  short validations can be done in the return statement; e.g.  return a<MIN_LENGTH;   -5
* toString() – redundant convoluted  implementation; discussed in class; calculate and store whole by using int division; calculate and store “new” numerator using % division; if whole >0 add it to the resulting string; if “new” numerator,  add  new numerator   + / + denominator to the resulting string -2
